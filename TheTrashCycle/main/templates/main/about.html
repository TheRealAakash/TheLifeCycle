	<p>The purpose of this project is to develop a website that can distinguish between different types of garbage. 
	
	</p>
	<p>
	The website will then return basic information about this piece of trash, such as if it is recyclable and how long it would take to decompose in nature. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This will help users better understand how the trash they produce affects the world long after they throw it out.
