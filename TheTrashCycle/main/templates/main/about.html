            <p>The purpose of this project is to develop a website that can distinguish between different types of garbage.

            </p>
            <p>
                The user will first upload an image of a piece of garbage. By utilizing a machine learning model, the website will detect the plastic in the photo.
            </p>

            <p>
                This will help users better understand how the trash they produce affects the world long after they throw it out.
