Recycling a tonne of newspaper also eliminates 3mÂ³ of landfill. As paper decomposes in the ground it produces methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas, thus recycling paper prevents ass much of these gasses from being produced and released into the environment, helping",
            "cardboard": "Cardboard produces Methane, a greenhouse gas as it breaks down. Thus, every bit of cardboard recycled prevents greenhouse gases escape into the atmosphere and limit global warming.",
            "biological": "Organic waste in landfills generates, methane, a potent greenhouse gas. By composting wasted food and other organics, methane emissions are significantly reduced. Compost reduces and in some cases eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers. Compost promotes higher yields of agricultural crops.",
            "metal": "Recycling scrap metal preserves natural resources that naturally occur in nature and aren't renewable. ... Additionally, producing new metals releases more greenhouse gas emissions than the recycling process does. Similarly, recycling scrap metal uses far less energy and less water than mining for ore.",

Recycling glass reduces the space in landfills that would otherwise be taken up by used bottles and jars.

Recycling glass reduces the space in landfills that would otherwise be taken up by used bottles and jars.

Recycling glass reduces the space in landfills that would otherwise be taken up by used bottles and jars. Using glass for recycling means there are less glass objects lying around in he landfill or bin.",

Reusing the fabric in old clothes means less resources, both monetary and environmental, are wasted in growing fiber for new ones.",
            "shoes": "A simple way to combat textile's impact on the Earth is to recycle instead of throwing out clothing. ... The clothes and shoes we have collected has saved about 300-400 million pounds of CO2 from entering the atmosphere each year, which is the equivalent of taking 26,000-35,000 cars off the road.",

Given the resistant nature of chemicals like PET, this gradual breakdown process can take years to complete. Plastic bottles, for instance, are estimated to require approximately 450 years to decompose in a landfill.",
