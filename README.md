# TheTrashCycle 
The purpose of this project is to develop a website that can distinguish between different types of garbage. The website will then return basic information about this piece of trash, such as if it is recyclable and how long it would take to decompose in nature. This will help users better understand how the trash they produce effects the world long after they throw it out.
